## Introduction

Welcome to the NFT College Reward System! This project aims to implement a reward system for college students using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). The system is designed to incentivize and recognize students for their achievements and contributions within the college community.

## Features

- **NFT-Based Rewards:** Issuing unique NFTs to students as digital certificates for achievements.
- **Smart Contracts:** Utilizing blockchain smart contracts for secure and transparent reward distribution.
- **User-friendly Interface:** An intuitive web interface for students to track and showcase their earned NFTs.
- **Decentralized Identity:** Leveraging blockchain for decentralized student identity verification.
